#Cloud Computing & AWS

## Defining Cloud Computing

- HAve computational resources or services available 
- THis can be either on the internet, or on an organisation-internal channel. A hybrid of hte two is also possible.
    - An example of this is banking, where confidential data will be managed on an internal cloud, but publically accessible files will be served from a public cloud
- Clouds are used by almost any larger organisation that requires computing services.

## AWS

- Amongst others, one of the biggest providers of cloud services
- used by a lot of companies
- Biggest advantage is that there is no longer a huge upfront cost to obtain machines 
- Also highly scalable with demand (can rent more or less computing capacity as needed)

## AWS Global Infrastructure

- AWS orders their services by REgions, each with mutiple availability zones
- Each region has at least 2 data centers to ensure availability
- Choosing a data center depends on a variety of factors:
    - Latency to data center (from user)
    - Cost of a particular region
    - legal considerations (some countries require data collected there to be handled there)
- Not all services are available in all regions
